    "# Deblurring Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Compact digital cameras were introduced in the early seventies thanks to the development of CCD sensors allowing the recording and storage of images in digital format. The goal of an image process is to capture an accurate representation of a particular scene. However, any image is influenced by the optical system itself and the overall effect is a blurred image reconstruction, therefore, specialized algorithms performing deblurring need to be implemented in order to achieve a sharper image. Image deblurring is a method that aims at recovering the original sharp-image by removing effect caused by limited aperture, lens aberrations, defocus, and unintended motions. This can be done by defining a mathematical model of the blurring process with the idea of removing from the image the blurring effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the main assumption is that the blurring process is linear. When this is the case, a 2-dimensional convolutional model describes the imaging problem. The blurred Image (output) is the result of a point-spread function acting on a target sharp image (input). Such process is described by the following transformation, \n",

    "g(x, y) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(x-x_0,y-y_0) f(x_0, y_0) dx_0 dy_0.\n",

    "This operation can be discretized as follows\n",

The previous definition is an specific case of the more general problem $\\mathbf{y} =  \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}$ (*forward operation*), where $\\mathbf{A}:\\mathbb{F}^m \\to \\mathbb{F}^n$ is a linear operator that maps a vector of size $m$ in the *model space* to a vector of size $n$ in the *data space*, as explained in the previous session. The (*adjoint operation*) is $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{A}^H \\mathbf{y}$. In this context, our deblurring operation is an inverse problem design to find a pseudoinverse, $\\mathbf{A}^{-1}$, that aims at removing the effect of the operator $\\mathbf{A}$ from the data $\\mathbf{y}$ to retrieve the model $\\mathbf{x}$, i.e., $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\mathbf{y}$. \n",

Depending on the application, different solvers are available, below we will compare the performance of some well-known algorithms to deblur the image and compare it with its original version.\n",
