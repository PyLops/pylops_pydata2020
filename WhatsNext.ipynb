    "    - running forward/adjoint steps (or even the entire inverse problem) on a GPU. \n",
    "    - easy wrapping of any of PyLops operators into a ``torch.autograd.Function`` via ``TorchOperator`` (https://pylops-gpu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/pylops_gpu.TorchOperator.html) - use PyLops operators within an autograd graph.\n",

    "- **Cupy** Integration in PyLops: given the level of maturity of Cupy, we have started to consider a direct integration in PyLops. This will allow operators to transparently use numpy or cupy depending on the input vectors"
